== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Google rich snippets are not being displayed, what can I do? =

The snippet code vocabulary has been updated. Have some patience and let google crawl your posts/pages again for some days. You could also check if the structured data is valid.

= Why can’t I see more than 5 reviews?=

The Google API only lets you see at most 5 reviews at a time. Our plugin will continue to collect reviews and over time, you can have the option to display more reviews on your page, especially ones that you are partial towards.
